On July 22, 1990, after a Soviet exhibition game in Portland's Memorial Coliseum, Detroit Red Wings executive Jim Lites secretly picked up Sergei Fedorov outside his hotel and whisked him away in owner Mike Ilitch's private jet. This dramatic defection marked the beginning of the "Russian Five" era that would revolutionize NHL hockey. Fedorov's escape from the Soviet system was carefully orchestrated, with the Red Wings taking enormous risks to secure one of hockey's most talented players. The move paid off spectacularly - Fedorov became the first European-trained player to win the Hart Trophy and helped Detroit win three Stanley Cups. His defection opened the floodgates for other Soviet stars and forever changed the international landscape of professional hockey.
