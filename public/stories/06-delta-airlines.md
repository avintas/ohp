Delta Airlines revolutionized hockey travel in 2019 by eliminating the notorious $150 sports equipment surcharge. Now one equipment bag plus two hockey sticks taped together counts as a single checked item under standard baggage fees. The 50-pound weight limit applies but overweight fees only kick in after that threshold. Your gear must fit within 115 linear inches (length + width + height) which accommodates most hockey bags except oversized goalie equipment. This policy change saves hockey families hundreds of dollars annually on tournament travel. The key is proper packing - use a designated hockey bag designed for air travel and tape sticks securely together. Pro tip: weigh your bag at home to avoid overweight surprises at the airport. Delta's hockey-friendly policy extends to all North American destinations making it the preferred airline for traveling teams and hockey families.
