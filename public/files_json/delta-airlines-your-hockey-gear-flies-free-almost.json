  "full_content": "Delta Airlines revolutionized hockey travel in 2019 by eliminating the notorious 150 dollar sports equipment surcharge. Now one equipment bag plus two hockey sticks taped together counts as a single checked item under standard baggage fees. The 50-pound weight limit applies but overweight fees only kick in after that threshold. Your gear must fit within 115 linear inches length plus width plus height which accommodates most hockey bags except oversized goalie equipment. This policy change saves hockey families hundreds of dollars annually on tournament travel. The key is proper packing - use a designated hockey bag designed for air travel and tape sticks securely together. Pro tip: weigh your bag at home to avoid overweight surprises at the airport. Delta's hockey-friendly policy extends to all North American destinations making it the preferred airline for traveling teams and hockey families.",
