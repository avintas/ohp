  "full_content": "Phil Esposito revolutionized hockey scoring through his deceptively simple philosophy: I go to the net. I stand there and I take abuse and I don't move. This approach transformed the center position from primarily a playmaker role to a goal-scoring machine. Esposito parked himself in the slot deflecting shots and collecting rebounds despite constant cross-checks and interference from defensemen. His willingness to absorb punishment in front of the net created scoring opportunities that previous generations of players had ignored. Most guys don't want to pay the price to score goals Esposito explained. They want to score from the outside where it's safe. His net-front presence contributed to five 100-point seasons and two Stanley Cup championships with Boston. Modern power forwards like Alexander Ovechkin and David Pastrnak still use Esposito's template: establish position absorb contact and capitalize on chaos around the crease.",
