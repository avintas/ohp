OnlyHockey is a digital platform designed to be the go-to destination for bite-sized, shareable hockey content. Here's what makes it unique:
The Core Concept
OnlyHockey solves a key problem in hockey fandom - content is typically scattered across platforms and often too lengthy for quick social sharing. Instead, it offers curated "tidbits" of hockey information in four engaging formats:

Factoids - Educational hockey facts and insights
Statoids - Data-driven hockey statistics and performance info
Motivoids - Inspirational quotes and philosophical hockey wisdom
Quizoids - Interactive hockey trivia and challenges

What Makes It Special
Shareable by Design: Every piece of content is optimized for one-click sharing to social platforms with proper formatting and OnlyHockey branding.
Character-Driven Storytelling: Content is delivered through authentic hockey personas - from equipment managers and coaches to analysts and team historians - each bringing their unique expertise and perspective.
Community Focus: Targets passionate hockey fans (18-45) who are active on social media, plus parents and grandparents looking for hockey-themed encouragement for their young players.
The Business Model
Beyond content, OnlyHockey monetizes through:

Digital hockey assets and downloads
Hockey-themed greeting cards
Branded merchandise celebrating hockey culture

The Mission
OnlyHockey exists to celebrate hockey's culture, humor, and grit while connecting players, fans, and families through easily shareable content that expresses their love for the game - both on and off the ice.
It's essentially creating a new category: hockey content specifically designed for the social media age.
