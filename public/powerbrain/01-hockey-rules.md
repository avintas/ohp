# Hockey Rules & Regulations

## Question
What happens when a player receives a major penalty in hockey?

## Answers
- A) Player sits in penalty box for 2 minutes
- B) Player sits in penalty box for 5 minutes
- C) Player is ejected from the game
- D) Team plays with 4 players for 10 minutes

## Correct Answer
**B) Player sits in penalty box for 5 minutes**

## Explanation
A major penalty results in the offending player sitting in the penalty box for 5 minutes, and their team must play shorthanded for the entire duration. Unlike minor penalties, major penalties cannot be ended early if the opposing team scores a goal.

## Fun Fact
Did you know? The longest penalty in NHL history was a 20-minute major penalty given to Boston's Eddie Shore in 1929 for attacking a referee!
