# Arenas & Venues

## Question
What is the official size of an NHL rink?

## Answers
- A) 180 feet x 80 feet
- B) 200 feet x 85 feet
- C) 185 feet x 85 feet
- D) 200 feet x 100 feet

## Correct Answer
**B) 200 feet x 85 feet**

## Explanation
NHL rinks are standardized at 200 feet long by 85 feet wide (61m x 26m). This is larger than international rinks, which are typically 200 feet x 100 feet, giving NHL players more room to maneuver.

## Fun Fact
Did you know? The smallest NHL arena ever was the Boston Garden, which was only 191 feet long and had a unique "dead spot" in the ice where the puck would sometimes stop moving!
