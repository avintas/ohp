## Question
What is the maximum length allowed for a hockey stick in the NHL?

## Answers
- A) 60 inches
- B) 63 inches
- C) 65 inches
- D) No limit

## Correct Answer
**B) 63 inches**

## Explanation
NHL rules state that hockey sticks cannot exceed 63 inches (160 cm) in length. This rule helps maintain fair play and prevents players from gaining an unfair advantage with extremely long sticks.

## Fun Fact
Did you know? The shortest NHL player ever, Roy Worters, was only 5'3" tall, but he still had to follow the same stick length rules as everyone else!
