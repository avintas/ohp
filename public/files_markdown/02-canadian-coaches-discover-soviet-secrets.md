In July 1974, a group of Canadian hockey coaches from across the country made a pilgrimage to Moscow's Red Army sports club, determined to understand why Soviet hockey had become so dominant. What they discovered was revolutionary: 11-year-olds doing the same drills as the national team, scientific player selection starting at age six, and state-sponsored training that integrated education with hockey development. "These kids are doing the same drills that the national team does," observed one stunned Canadian coach. "Our guys, from 12 to 15 or 17, they don't get the same type of training." The coaches concluded that while the Soviet system was moving ahead quickly, Canada's development system was standing still. This mission directly influenced the modern youth hockey development programs we see today.
